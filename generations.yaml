generations:
  - name: "First Generation"
    start_year: 1995
    end_year: 2002
    description: "The first-generation Renault Megane replaced the Renault 19 as the company's entry in the compact car segment. Designed by Patrick Le Quément, it introduced a distinctive design language that would influence Renault's lineup through the late 1990s. Initially available as a three-door and five-door hatchback, the range later expanded to include a four-door sedan (Classic), a coupe, a convertible, and an estate (Grandtour) variant. Engine options ranged from 1.4-liter to 2.0-liter gasoline units and several diesel options, primarily the 1.9 dTi and 1.9 dCi. The performance-oriented 2.0 16v version offered 150 horsepower, while the limited Megane Maxi kit car homologation version produced 280 horsepower. The interior was conventional for its era with a focus on practicality rather than style. The Megane achieved a 4-star Euro NCAP safety rating in 1997—impressive for its time—and was the first car in its class to offer curtain airbags. A facelift in 1999 updated the styling with revised headlights, bumpers, and interior details. This generation established the Megane as a key competitor in the European compact car market, combining practicality with a distinctive design."

  - name: "Second Generation"
    start_year: 2002
    end_year: 2009
    description: "The second-generation Renault Megane marked a bold styling departure with its distinctive rear end featuring a prominent window and tailgate design often referred to as the 'bustle-back.' Designed under Patrick Le Quément, this generation continued Renault's design renaissance with unique styling that polarized opinion but certainly stood out in the crowded compact segment. Available in three-door (Sport Hatch) and five-door hatchback, sedan (in some markets), coupe-cabriolet (featuring a folding metal roof), and estate (Grandtour) body styles. Engine options expanded to include gasoline units from 1.4 to 2.0 liters, including the 2.0-liter turbocharged engine in the Renault Sport versions producing up to 225 horsepower in the R26.R special edition. Diesel options were a major focus, with the 1.5 dCi and 1.9 dCi engines gaining popularity for their efficiency. The interior featured improved quality with a more driver-focused design, digital speedometer displayed in the center of the dashboard, and keyless entry and start on higher trim levels—innovative for its segment at the time. Safety was a priority with the car achieving a 5-star Euro NCAP rating. The Renault Sport variants, particularly the R26.R which featured extensive weight reduction measures including polycarbonate windows and eliminated rear seats, earned acclaim for their handling and performance, cementing Renault's reputation for producing excellent hot hatchbacks."

  - name: "Third Generation"
    start_year: 2008
    end_year: 2016
    description: "The third-generation Renault Megane adopted a more conventional but elegant design compared to its distinctive predecessor, focusing on perceived quality and refinement. Designed under Patrick Le Quément, this Megane featured more flowing lines and a premium appearance. Available as a five-door hatchback, three-door coupe, estate (Sport Tourer), and a coupe-cabriolet with a folding metal roof. Engine options included gasoline units from 1.2 TCe to 2.0-liter, and diesel engines from the efficient 1.5 dCi to the more powerful 1.6 dCi and 2.0 dCi. The Renault Sport versions featured a 2.0-liter turbocharged engine producing 250 horsepower initially, later increased to 265 hp and ultimately 275 hp in the Trophy-R variant, which set a front-wheel-drive Nürburgring lap record in 2014. The interior quality saw significant improvement with soft-touch materials, ambient lighting, and a more cohesive design. Technology features expanded to include a hands-free card key system, TomTom-based navigation, and the introduction of Renault's R-Link infotainment system in later models. A significant facelift in 2012 updated the front end with Renault's new design identity featuring a prominent diamond logo and sleeker headlights. The third-generation Megane further developed Renault's position in the competitive compact segment, with particular strengths in ride comfort, fuel efficiency with the diesel engines, and exceptional handling in the Renault Sport variants."

  - name: "Fourth Generation"
    start_year: 2016
    end_year: 2021
    description: "The fourth-generation Renault Megane, designed under Laurens van den Acker, featured a more distinctive and dynamic design with pronounced shoulders, C-shaped LED daytime running lights, and connected rear lights creating a horizontal signature. Built on the Common Module Family (CMF-C/D) platform shared with the Nissan Pulsar and Renault Kadjar, the Megane grew slightly in size while adopting a wider, lower stance for a more athletic appearance. Available as a five-door hatchback and estate (Sport Tourer), though coupe and convertible variants were discontinued. Engine options included the 1.2 TCe and 1.6 TCe gasoline engines, a hybrid option added later, and the 1.5 dCi and 1.6 dCi diesel engines, with power outputs ranging from 110 to 205 horsepower in standard models. The performance GT variant featured 4Control four-wheel steering—unique in the segment. The Renault Sport model came exclusively with a 1.8-liter turbocharged engine producing 280 horsepower, available with either a 6-speed manual or dual-clutch automatic transmission. The interior represents a significant technological leap with the portrait-oriented 8.7-inch R-Link 2 touchscreen infotainment system on higher trims, customizable ambient lighting, and a digital instrument cluster. A comprehensive suite of driver assistance systems was available including adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, and automated parking. The fourth-generation Megane faced increasing competition from both traditional rivals and the growing SUV segment, leading Renault to focus more on the crossover variants in many markets while transitioning the Megane nameplate toward electrification."

  - name: "Fifth Generation"
    start_year: 2022
    end_year: null
    description: "The fifth-generation Renault Megane represents a fundamental reinvention of the nameplate, transitioning it fully into the electric era with the Megane E-Tech Electric. Designed under Laurens van den Acker, this generation abandons internal combustion entirely and adopts a compact crossover-hatchback form factor, blending traditional hatch proportions with SUV-inspired cues such as a higher beltline and larger wheels. Built on the dedicated CMF-EV platform developed by the Renault–Nissan–Mitsubishi Alliance, the Megane E-Tech features a flat battery pack integrated into the floor, enabling a long wheelbase, short overhangs, and a low center of gravity. Powertrain options include a single front-mounted electric motor producing either 130 or 220 horsepower, paired with battery capacities of 40 kWh or 60 kWh, delivering WLTP ranges of up to approximately 470 km (292 miles). The interior marks a major technological leap, highlighted by the OpenR cockpit—a dual-screen layout combining a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster with a vertical 12-inch infotainment display running Android Automotive OS with native Google services. Material quality and sustainability are emphasized through recycled fabrics and minimalist design. Advanced driver assistance systems are standard or optional depending on trim, including adaptive cruise control, lane centering, and hands-free highway driving capabilities. With this generation, Renault repositions the Megane as a technology-forward, electric-focused model aimed at competing with vehicles such as the Volkswagen ID.3 and Cupra Born, signaling the brand’s broader shift away from traditional compact hatchbacks toward electrified mobility solutions."
